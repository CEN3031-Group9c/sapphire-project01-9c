### Colors
This section defines a set of primary and secondary colors that can be easily referenced in our styles. For example, `primary` and `secondary` colors are defined as `#3D5C82` and `#5BABDE`, respectively. We can use these color variables in your styles for consistency and easy color management.

### Flexbox Layouts
The file provides a set of CSS classes for flexbox layouts. We can use these classes to control the layout and alignment of your elements. For example, we can apply the `.flex` class to make an element a flex container, or use `.flex-row` and `.flex-column` to set the flex direction.

### Containers
The `container` and `vertical-container` classes define container styles for our web content. The `container` class creates a full-height and width container with a specified background color. The `vertical-container` class can be used to add margins to your content.

### Hover Effects
The `.hvr-info` class is included for elements that should change their appearance when hovered over. It sets the cursor to a pointer and provides a visual cue for interactivity.

### Cards
The `.card` class is designed for creating cards with a background color of `#F4F4F5` and padding for content.

### Overflow
The `.overflow-visible` and `.overflow-hidden` classes can be used to control the overflow behavior of elements. Use these classes to show or hide overflowing content.

### Navigation Padding
The `.nav-padding` class adds padding to the top of an element, typically used for creating space for navigation menus or headers.

### Replay Button
The `.replayButton` class is intended for elements that act as replay buttons and changes the cursor to a pointer for better user feedback.

### Text Styles
The file defines typography styles, including font sizes and font weights. We can use classes like `.text-primary`, `.text-secondary`, and `.heading` to apply text styles to your content.

### Spacing and Margins
Utility classes for spacing and margins are provided, such as `.m-1`, `.mt-2`, and `.mb-3`. These classes make it easy to add consistent spacing between elements.

### Button Styles
Button styles are included for primary and secondary buttons. The primary button uses the `#3D5C82` background color, and the secondary button uses `#5BABDE`. We can customize these buttons to suit our project's needs.

### Form Elements
Styles for input fields and checkboxes are defined in the `style.less` file. Input fields have a width of 100%, and checkboxes are displayed with aligned center content.
